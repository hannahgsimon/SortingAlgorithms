The program has the following menu options:  
1- Author info  
2- Add Student  
3- Add Faculty  
4- Sort by ID (selection sort)  
5- Sort by ID (radix sort)  
6- Sort Student by GPA (merge sort)  
7- Sort Faculty by course load (insertion sort)  
8- Print data  
0- Exit  

Where:  
1 prints the program author info  
2 allows the user to enter new student data, including name, ID, and GPA  
3 allows the user to enter new faculty data, including name, ID, and course load  
4 asks the user to pick faculty or students, then sorts the entered data of the chosen type in ascending order by ID value using selection sort  
5 asks the user to pick faculty or students, then sorts the entered data of the chosen type in descending order by ID value, using radix sort  
6 sorts the students by GPA in ascending order, using merge sort  
7 sorts the faculty by course load in ascending order, using insertion sort  
8 prints all student and faculty data  
0 exits the program  
  
The code also provides an extra "hidden" menu option -1, if the user select this option the student and faculty data will be filled with sample data.  

The Faculty and Student classes implement the Comparable interface.
